# 2D Minecraft-Inspired World-Building Game

Welcome to a simplified, Minecraft-inspired 2D game that allows users to interact with blocks, gather resources, and modify the environment using various tools. Players can dig, collect, and manage resources like grass, soil, and wood, each with specific behaviors tied to the tool they use.

## Gameplay Features

- **Shovel**: The shovel can dig **grass** (once) and **soil** (twice). Grass blocks are dug only once, while soil blocks require two digs. After digging, the block changes its appearance, and the resource counters for grass and soil are incremented accordingly.
- **Axe**: The axe chops down **tree branches** and **tree bases**. Each tree base block increases the wood counter by 1 and converts the block into the sky, representing its removal from the game world.
- **Pickaxe**: (Planned feature) The pickaxe will interact with stone and related blocks, designed for mining minerals and other underground resources.

## Class Structure & Design

The game logic revolves around the interaction of tools and blocks, managed through JavaScript functions and DOM manipulation.
